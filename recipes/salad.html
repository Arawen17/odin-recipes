    <h1>Salad</h1>
    <p>You'll love taking this Asian slaw to summer picnics or BBQs! It's easy to make ahead, so it's also one of my favorite choices for a quick weekday lunch. Vegan and gluten-free.
    </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>6 to 7 cups shredded red and/or green cabbage</li>
<li>Mix of peppers</li>
<li>2 scallions, chopped </li>
<li>½ cup chopped cilantro, including stems </li>
<li>½ cup fresh basil, Thai basil, and/or mint</li>
<li>¼ cup toasted peanuts, pepitas, and/or sesame seeds</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the cashew butter, miso paste, lime juice, sesame oil, and ginger. Whisk in enough water to create a drizzable consistency. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat, char the peppers whole, rotating until the edges have a little char, about 2 minutes per side. Remove. When cool to the touch, slice in half lengthwise, remove the stem, ribbing, and seeds and slice horizontally into thin strips.
    </li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, peppers, scallions, cilantro, basil, chiles, and ¾ of the dressing. Toss until combined. Add the remaining dressing, if desired, and season to taste with a few pinches of sea salt. Serve topped with the toasted nuts, seeds, and sliced peaches.</li>
